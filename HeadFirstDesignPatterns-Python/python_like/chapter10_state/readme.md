# Chapter 10: State design pattern

> **State Pattern**: allows an object to alter its behaviour when its internal state changes.

The class structure is the same as the Strategy Design Pattern but the intent is different : In the State pattern the
subclasses represent specific application states and may cover multiple attributes and methods whereas Strategy allows
an algorithm to be selected upon arbitrary criteria and would typically just apply to a single method.

## Running the code

```bash
python gumballstate.py
```
