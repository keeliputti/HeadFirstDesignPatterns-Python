# Chapter 9: Iterator and Composite design patterns

> **Iterator Method**: provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its
> underlying representation.

Java offers either the "Look Before You Leap" (LBYL) philosophy or the "Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than for
Permission"(EAFP) with its [`iterator`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html) interface:
The former involves calling `hasNext()` prior to calling `next()` whilst the latter uses the more
recent `forEachRemaining()` method.

Iteration is built in to the Python object model.

Python requires only the `__iter__()` method to be implemented for an object to return `True`
to `isinstance(obj, Iterable)`, however if an object implements just `__getitem__()` without `__iter__` then it will
function as an iterable in Cpython!

> **Composite Pattern**: allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent whole-part hierarchies.
> Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
