# Chapter 6: Command design pattern

> **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests,
> queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

## Use in Python

[Threading](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html) In the Python standard library follows the command design
pattern: The _Client_ is the main thread and the _receiver_ is the target thread. The _Command_ is a callable Python
object which is executed by calling its `__call__()` method. The _Invoker_ is the `Thread` instance and its `run()`
method is equivalent to calling _execute_ in the Command pattern. `Thread`'s `run` method can be overridden in
subclasses to customise the functionality beyond simply providing a function and input `args` and `kwargs`.

## Running the code

```bash
python remote_undo.py
```
